      Microlending involves granting small loans to people in need. These loans are generally used by entrepreneurs with
      a business idea or those who need extra cash to expand. In that sense, they aren't much different from small
      business loans. However, microlending is actually much different. What makes these loans unique are the
      motivations behind it, the sizes of loans, and the people involved.
